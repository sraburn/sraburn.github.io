This course introduces students to the concepts central to effective and efficient writing in the workplace. Students will learn to analyze the rhetorical context that gives rise to common business genres (e.g., meeting minutes, email requests, executive summaries, internal proposals, etc.). Based on rhetorical analysis, students will be able to develop content and manipulate organization and style, as well as use standard grammar and mechanics. Writing proficiency is required for a passing grade in this course. A student who does not write with the skill normally required of an upper-division student will not earn a passing grade, no matter how well the student performs in other areas of the course. Students are limited to three attempts for this course, excluding withdrawals.
