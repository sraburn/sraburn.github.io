I am a fifth-year Ph.D. Candidate in Agricultural and Resource Economics at UC Davis and I am currently on the Job Market! 

I was born in Germany and moved with my family to the U.S. as a child. I received both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Economics at the University of Alabama, where I worked on research related to Latin American banana production and the Prebisch-Singer hypothesis. Currently, I am finishing my Ph.D. on the optimality of organic strawberry production standards under the supervision of Professor Rachael Goodhue. 

For my job market paper, I study the optimality of production standards for organic strawberries. Using proprietary data I collected through communicating with industry members, I find that eliminating a loophole which allows organic strawberry producers to use non-organic seedlings would increase production costs by over $20 million per year, with few consumers realizing any change in product quality. As a Graduate Student Researcher, I also work with the California Department of Food and Agriculture to analyze the economic impact of state and federal policies. 

I previously worked at BNSF and the Marilyn Hewson Data Analytics Lab where I became proficient in software including Python, R, STATA, and Tableau. In my free time I enjoy doing cartography, learning Mandarin, and playing Catan.
