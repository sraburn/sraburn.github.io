I am a fifth-year Ph.D. Candidate in Agricultural and Resource Economics at UC Davis, under the supervision of Professor Rachael Goodhue. I am on the Job Market for the 2024-2025 cycle. My primary fields of interest are agricultural production and agricultural policy, with my research covering topics on agricultural policy analysis, organic production, and consumption trends. 

In my job market paper, I study the optimality of production standards for organic strawberries. Using proprietary data I collected through communicating with industry members, I find that eliminating a loophole which allows organic strawberry producers to use non-organic seedlings almost always reduces social welfare. In addition to over $20 million per year in increased production costs, requiring organic strawberry seedlings would also inadvertently reduce organic strawberry consumption. 

I also collaborate with the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) and the Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR) to analyze the economic impact of pesticide policies. Through these interdisciplinary collaborations, I have co-published two papers, with additional works in progress.
