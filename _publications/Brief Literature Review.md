The purpose of this very brief review is to provide context for how four types of policy tools could affect growersâ€™ pesticide use by presenting studies of their effects in other settings. Subsidies, costsharing and other direct financial benefits are considered in the context of the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices. Insurance is presented in the context of crop insurance. Taxes based on product characteristics are presented in the context of taxes on sugary beverages. Procurement policies are presented in the context of encouraging more organic production. The review is not comprehensive for any of these topics, nor is it intended to be. It begins with a short summary of key findings and their implications for enhancing the sustainability of pest management, followed by the published abstracts for all articles, organized by topic.
